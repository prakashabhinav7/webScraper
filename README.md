# webScraper
A basic web scraper that scrapes a web page and creates a dataframe with the latest prices of the product. 

This is more for websites that do not provide  APIs to communicate with their contect  e.g. small websites.

Further improvements could be to automate the building of all the URLs and the program could just crawl over the URLs.
